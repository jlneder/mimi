# Improvements from the original mimi

## New features

  In addition, I have added the following:
  - support for custom `menu` programs in alternative to `dmenu`, by setting the `MENU` and `MENUARGS` configuration variable. `MENU` has to be an executable, and also compatible with `dmenu`'s `-p` flag;
  i.e. for `rofi` use `MENU: rofi -dmenu`. If `MENU` is not set AND `dmenu` is not available, a notification is sent to the user.
  - custom handling of `mailto`, `spotify` and `tg`(telegram) URI protocols via the `x-scheme-handler` mimetype(!)
  - support for environmental variables (e.g. `$EDITOR`)
  - support for multiple arguments in `Exec` field of `.desktop` files
  - support for symbolic links
  - apps in your `$PATH` are now correctly listed when choosing an opener from `${
  MENU:-dmenu}
  `
  - fixed running in background for non-interactive mode
  - prioritized the user's configuration for .desktop files

I have also collected a few commits from some other forks, which allow for shell interactive usage and handling of HTML urls' `#section` suffixes.

If you think of something (i.e. a protocol) that mimi should be able to handle, feel free to open an issue!

## Xdg-email

I have also added a drop-in replacement for the `xdg-email` script, part of the common `xdg-utils` package, because some applications (such as `chromium`) use it to handle the
`mailto` protocol.
This script simply calls `xdg-open` (aka `mimi`) instead.

## Example configuration

``` sh
! This is a comment
TERM: st

! Default option
MENU: dmenu

# This is also a comment
audio/: mpv
video/: mpv
image/: sxiv
pdf: zathura
# Environmental variables also work
application/json: $TERMINAL -e $EDITOR
text/html: chromium
text/xml: chromium
application/xhtml_xml: chromium
x-scheme-handler/http: chromium
x-scheme-handler/https: chromium
x-scheme-handler/ftp: chromium
x-scheme-handler/about = chromium
x-scheme-handler/unknown = chromium

! vim: ft = xdefaults
```

## Tips and tricks

- If your `TERM` variable is not executable (i.e. if it is set to `st-256color`), you might want to set `TERM: yourterminal` in your `mimi.conf`.
- You can set `MENU` and `MENUARGS` in order to use a dmenu alternative. For instance, to use `rofi`:
``` cfg
MENU: rofi
MENUARGS: -dmenu
```
- __Note__ that `MENUARGS` can also be used to pass additional arguments to `dmenu`, but you will need to define the `MENU` variable in order for these to be parsed. Additionally,
  if `MENUARGS` contains more than one argument, these should be separated by a colon `:`. For instance:
``` cfg
MENU: dmenu
MENUARGS: -b:-i:-f
```

# Installation

## From Git

  - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BachoSeven/mimi.git`
  - To replace the system's `xdg-open` and `xdg-email`, just do `sudo make install`.

## From AUR

  You can find a handy `xdg-utils`-conflicting package [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mimi-bachoseven-git/).

# Old README
## What is this?
  mimi is an improved version of xdg-open.
  The original xdg-open works horribly without DE environment.

### usage
  1. you can define a list of 'how-to-open' in '~/.config/mimi/mimi.conf' (read below for format)
  2. or you are lazy, mimi will search a best-fit app using .desktop file. Best fit is defined as
  the first option sorted by mime order and then , if they have the same mime order, reverse sorted by generality

  for example, the best-fit app says it can open 'text/html' in the very beginning of its mime definition.
  if two or more apps have the same priority, then we choose the app that can open the most number of file types.

### search order
  for example, I want to define how to open 'text/html'. mimi will search in order like this

  1. 'txt' in your config
  2. <protocol> in your config (i.e. http, ftp, magnet) ...etc.
  3. 'text/html' in your config
  4. 'text/' in your config
  5. 'text/html' in .desktop
  6. 'text/' in .desktop
  7. if mimi still cannot find anything, it will open dmenu and bug you.

  note:

  1. sometimes, mimi is smart enough to figure out protocol based on mime-type when it searches for .desktop.
  2. sometimes, if an app requires a terminal to run (ncurses programs), mimi is able to find one terminal app in .desktop.

### customize
  this is my own stuff

  text/: xterm -e vim
  application/pdf: zathura
  video/: vlc
  image/: feh
  audio/: vlc
  application/x-tar: xterm -e 2a
  application/x-gzip: xterm -e 2a
  application/x-bzip2: xterm -e 2a
  application/x-rar: xterm -e 2a
  application/x-xz: xterm -e 2a
  application/zip: xterm -e 2a
  inode/directory: xterm -e ranger

  it can be simplified by using:

  rar: xterm -e 2a

  but if you have time, using mime-type is more precise
